Why? If you think about our entitre ShotGrid set-up it all relies on one thing: a shared storage for us all to work off of. Syncthing, an open-source peer-to-peer file synchronization tool, offers a robust solution by enabling devices to synchronize files directly with each other over a secure, encrypted connection. With some handy drive letter mapping, Syncthing gives us the coveted storage platform we need for ShotGrid to organize our company's workflow properly."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"architecture",children:"Architecture"}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"At its core, Syncthing utilizes a decentralized model, eschewing traditional client-server architectures for a peer-to-peer approach. This design facilitates direct data exchange between devices, ensuring efficiency and redundancy. Each device in the network operates both as a client and a server, contributing to the system's resilience and scalability. Syncthing incorporates Block Exchange Protocol (BEP) for efficient data transfer, employing a block-based synchronization mechanism that minimizes data transfer by only exchanging modified blocks within files. This means that while an initial sync can take a while, further syncs down the line are much faster because only changes are synced."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"security",children:"Security"}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Security in Syncthing is essential to stave off accusations of it being sketchy and open source, they employ TLS encryption to secure data transfers between devices.
