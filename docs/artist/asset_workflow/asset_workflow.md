# Asset Workflow

> This article explains how to Add Assets to Shotgrid, break them down into tasks, Open them, Build the Enclosed Maya Folders and Publish

## Asset Lifecycle

Create in Shotgrid -> Break down into Tasks -> Open and work on -> Publish as Scene, Baked Format (abc, fbx, usd), and Playblast -> Open in next Task/Step (if necessary), repeat steps Open and Publish -> Open up CG Shot Task -> Import Asset -> Create scene -> Publish as Scene and Render (will create .mov).

##  Adding the Asset to Shotgrid

1. Navigate to the page for your project in Shotgrid and click the Assets tab:

## Opening The Asset

Once you've assigned your tasks, they will be visible in the Shotgrid Workfiles app (File Open) and you'll be able to work within a context oriented folder structure generated by Shotgrid.

1. Launch Maya from Shotgrid Desktop and navigate to File Open in Maya

2. Open the asset you created on Shotgrid and assigned based on the step in the process (task) you want to work on.

## Building the Usual Maya Folders

With your file open in the correct context, you can now build your Maya folder structure.

1. Open the Project Window by going to File -> Project Window

2. Finalize the folder structure you want within this Maya Project
>Note that some of these locations will be overridden (not overwritten) by the TEMPLATE.yml file in our Config.

3. You can check your folder structure to make sure your Maya Project sits nicely in the right context.
>Note: because you are still working in the relative file path and all your Maya files are in the right place, any scenes, caches, playblasts and renders will still end up where they need to be.
