# Archiving

> This topic will discuss how to archive a project after it has been finaled and ready to be wrapped up.

Once your project is finished, shots are marked [final](/docs/coordinator/statuses), and you're ready to archive, you can follow these steps below:

1. Ensure you've received all Nuke/project files from artists, both from in-house and contractors.

2. Make sure all files on Suite are copied over to Basket, if they do not exist there already. Check that everything was copied correctly by getting the properties/info on the copied and created folder, to make sure they have the same file size.

3. Organize them to reflect the folder organization established in the Basket server.

4. After making sure that everything is transferred over, you may delete the entire show folder from Suite.

5. Once everything is in place in Basket, message the archive manager asking them to please archive the show when they are next available. Ensure that your message contains the three things below.

      - The three-digit show code (ex. ABC)

      - The full name of the show (ex. Always Be Careful)

      - The path to the show in Basket (ex. Path: Basket\Commercial\ABC)

6. After some time, check back in to see if the show was successfully archived.

:::info
You can now make use of the [Baked Tools App](/baked-docs/docs/software/baked_app/) for this process.
